Metabolomics techniques have been used to study metabolic shifts including changes of metabolite concentrations and disturbed metabolic pathways in the progression of CC, and expand further fundamental understanding of muscle loss. In this article, we aim to review the research progress and applications of metabolomics on CC in the past decade, and provide a theoretical basis for the study of prediction, early diagnosis, and therapy of CC.},

  abstract = {Cachexia is a multifactorial disease characterized by weight loss via skeletal muscle and adipose tissue loss, an imbalance in metabolic regulation, and reduced food intake. It is caused by factors of catabolism produced by tumors in the systemic circulation as well as physiological factors such as the imbalanced inflammatory activation, proteolysis, autophagy, and lipolysis that may occur with gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, lung cancer, liver, and bowel cancer. Cancer cachexia not only negatively affects the quality of life of patients with cancer but also reduces the effectiveness of anti-cancer chemotherapy and increases its toxicity, leading to increased cancer-related mortality and expenditure of medical resources. Currently, there are no effective medical interventions to completely reverse cachexia and no approved drugs. Adequate nutritional support is the main method of cachexia treatment, while drugs that target the inhibition of catabolism, cell damage, and excessive activation of inflammation are under study. This article reviews recent advances in the diagnosis, staging, and evaluation of cancer cachexia.},

  abstract = {Cachexia, in the form of unintentional weight loss {$>$}5\% in 12~months or less, and secondary sarcopenia in the form of muscle wasting are serious conditions that affect clinical outcomes. A chronic disease state such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) often contributes to these wasting disorders. The purpose of this review is to summarize the prevalence of cachexia and sarcopenia, their relationship with kidney function, and indicators for evaluating kidney function in patients with CKD. It is estimated that approximately half of all persons with CKD will develop cachexia with an estimated annual mortality rate of 20\%, but few studies have been conducted on cachexia in CKD. Hence, the true prevalence of cachexia in CKD and its effects on kidney function and patient outcomes remain unclear. Some studies have highlighted the concept of protein-energy wasting (PEW) which usually include sarcopenia and cachexia. Several studies have examined kidney function and CKD progression in patients with sarcopenia. Most studies use serum creatinine levels to estimate kidney function. However, creatinine may be influenced by muscle mass, and creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate may overestimate kidney function in patients with reduced muscle mass or muscle wasting. Cystatin C, which is least affected by muscle mass, has been used in some studies, and creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio has emerged as an important prognostic marker. A previous study incorporating 428~320 participants reported that participants with CKD and sarcopenia had a 33\% higher hazard of mortality compared with those without (7\% to 66\%, P~=~0.011), and that those with sarcopenia were twice as likely to develop end-stage kidney disease (hazard ratio: 1.98; 1.45 to 2.70, P~{$<~$}0.001). Future studies on cachexia and sarcopenia in patients with CKD are needed to report rigorously defined cachexia concerning kidney function. Moreover, in studies on sarcopenia with CKD, it is desirable to accumulate studies using cystatin C to accurately estimate kidney function.},

  abstract = {Sarcopenia among the older population has been growing over the last few years. In addition, the incidence of cancers increases with age and, consequently, the development of cachexia related cancer. Therefore, the elucidation of the metabolic derangements of sarcopenia and cachexia are important to improve the survival and life quality of cancer patients. We performed the 1H-NMR based serum metabolomics in adult (A) and ageing (S) Walker 256 tumour-bearing rats in different stages of tumour evolution, namely intermediated (Wi) and advanced (Wa). Among 52 serum metabolites that were identified, 21 were significantly increased in S and 14 and 19 decreased in the Wi and Wa groups, respectively. The most impacted pathways by this metabolic alteration were related by amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, with an upregulation in S group and downregulation in Wi and Wa groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the increase in metabolic profile in ageing rats is associated with the higher muscle protein degradation that releases several metabolites, especially amino acids into the serum. On the other hand, we hypothesise that the majority of metabolites released by muscle catabolism are used by tumours to sustain rapid cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.},
